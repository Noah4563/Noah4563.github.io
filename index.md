Im a first year computer science major at Csuf and plan to graduate in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 2 part 1
This was one of my favorite labs because it was one of the first labs that we started. Also it was one of the first ever labs we actually had to try on to get the formatting right. This lab is also where I got to work with my first partner and learned how to collaborate with someone else on coding.

* Lab 12 part 1
Lab 12 was my second favorite lab because of how the goal was to create an image. Also the lab was pretty good because it was one of the more challenging labs we had to work on. I also liked how had to use three loops which to me are challenging so it was a challenge to finish the code for part 1

* Lab  11 part 1 & 2
Lab 11 was by far one of my favorite labs because I did it all by myself since I wasn't able to attend lab because I was sick. It was also pretty challenging because I kept running into many errors that I eventually learned to fix. I also thought it was pretty interesting how we had to calculate everything for the pizza.
